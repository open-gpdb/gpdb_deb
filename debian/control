Description: Pivotal Greenplum PXF
  The Greenplum Platform Extension Framework (PXF) provides parallel, high
  throughput data access and federated queries across heterogeneous data
  sources via built-in connectors that map a Greenplum Database external
  table definition to an external data source. This Greenplum Database
  extension is based on PXF from Apache HAWQ (incubating).
